>[!NOTE]
>This project was a personal experiment in "vibe coding" ‚Äî a workflow where a developer prompts an application into existence. Instead of a simple featuring prompting, I provided a detailed architectural brief, a techincal stack requirement document, and iterative feedback throughout the process. While more than 50% of the code was generated by GitHub Copilot Agent(LLM), all code was manually reviewed, adjusted, tested, and refactored by me. The goal was to create a tool for a personal need while exploring the process of LLM-assisted development, not to create a enterprise product.
>
>Now, I understand that people have strong opinions about the rise of AI and LLM-assisted coding, and I respect those views ‚Äî I‚Äôm not here to argue for or against them. What I do recognize is that this is likely the direction the industry is heading, and it‚Äôs better to be on the train than to get run over by it. My aim is to explore the process, strengths, and limitations of LLM-assisted, flow-driven development as a tool in the modern developer‚Äôs workflow and toolbox.

## üìñ Overview

Chronos is a time tracking tool designed for freelancers, contractors, and anyone who needs to track their work hours. It features a modern terminal user interface (TUI) built with Go, Bubble Tea, and Lipgloss, and integrates local LLM capabilities for smart suggestions and feedback. Chronos allows users to log time using natural language, organize work into blocks, and export time entries as invoices in various formats.
It is designed to be user-friendly, with a focus on developer ergonomics and input safety.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Natural Language Time Entry:** Log time with phrases like `2h today on UI Design -- client review`.
- **Block-Based Tracking:** Organize work into sprints, projects, or phases ("blocks").
- **Modern TUI:** Interactive, Solarized-themed interface built with Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, and Huh.
- **LLM-Powered Suggestions & Feedback:** Get smart entry suggestions, reminders, summaries, and analytics from a local LLM (Ollama/llama.cpp, 7B+).
- **Invoice-Ready Exports:** Export time as JSON or Markdown invoices, with Glamour rendering.
- **Entry Templates & Snippets:** Save and reuse common entries.
- **Smart Invoicing:** Detect and mark unbilled entries for easy invoicing.
- **Configurable Defaults:** Set your preferred rate, billable status, and theme.
- **Robust Input Sanitization:** All user input is validated and sanitized for safety.
- **Extensive CLI & TUI Workflows:** Add, block, view, export, summarize, ask, suggest, complete, template, invoice, edit, delete, analytics, review, Pomodoro, idle-detect, and more.
